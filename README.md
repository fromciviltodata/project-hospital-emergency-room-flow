### 📊 Project Overview

This dashboard presents a comprehensive analysis of emergency room (ER) operations over one year, highlighting patient flow, waiting times, admissions, referrals, and demographics.

Built entirely in Power BI, the dashboard helps identify operational bottlenecks and uncover actionable insights to improve efficiency, patient satisfaction, and resource allocation.

### 🚑 What the Dashboard Shows

### Key KPIs (Top Panel)

* **Total Patients:** 299 in the selected month

* **Avg. Waiting Time:** 36.6 minutes ⏳

* **Patient Satisfaction Score:** 5.07/10

* **No. of Patients Referred:** 128

👉 Each KPI is supported by a trend line, allowing quick identification of rising or falling patterns

### Operational Insights (Main Visuals)

* **Admission Status:** Almost half of ER patients are admitted (44%), while 56% are treated and discharged.

* **Patients Seen Within 30 Minutes:** Only 35% met the timeliness target — a red flag for efficiency.

* **By Age Group:** The 10–29 age bracket dominates ER visits, suggesting a younger demographic faces higher ER demand.

* **By Gender:** Patient volume is almost evenly split (49% male, 51% female).

* **By Race:** White and African American patients make up the largest groups, followed by Asian and mixed-race patients.

* **By Department Referral:** General Practice and Orthopedics are the most frequently referred specialties — potential areas needing extra staffing.

* **Patient Flow by Day & Hour:** Saturdays see the highest visits, with clear spikes during morning (7–10 AM) and late afternoon (3–6 PM).

### 🔍 Why This Matters

This dashboard doesn’t just display numbers — it **tells the story of how patients move through the ER:**

Long wait times highlight **bottlenecks in triage or staffing.**

Referral patterns show **pressure points in departments like Orthopedics.**

Time-of-day analysis reveals **critical staffing windows**, helping hospitals plan shifts more strategically.

Demographic splits (age, gender, race) provide opportunities to design **patient-centered care strategies.**

### 📂 Project Structure

1. **Monthly View (shown above)** → KPI overview, demographics, time-based flow

2. **Consolidated View →** Departmental analysis, deeper referral trends

3. **Patient Details →** Record-level drill-down with demographic filters

4. **Analytical Highlights →** Key takeaways, policy/operational recommendations

### ✅ Key Takeaways

* **Wait Time Challenge:** With only 35% of patients seen within 30 minutes, process redesign is needed.

* **Staffing Needs:** Orthopedics and General Practice show consistent demand spikes.

* **Demographic Insights:** Younger patients drive higher ER traffic, while elderly patients report slightly lower satisfaction.

* **Peak Hours:** Staffing should be reinforced in **morning and weekend shifts.**

### 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Add **forecasting models** to predict patient inflows.

* Apply **predictive analytics** to anticipate admission likelihood.

* Integrate real-time data for live **ER monitoring.**
